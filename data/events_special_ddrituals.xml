	<text>Arriving at the beacon, you find yourself within a pocket of strange clouds. Brief flashes of light can occasionally be seen as lightning weaves its way from cloud to cloud, but, otherwise, you don't spot anything of note.</text>

			<text>As thoughts race through your mind, an object in the dark space outside catches your attention. At first, it's difficult to make due to its distance, but you quickly realize exactly what it is as a glint of white shines out from its center. It's the Minister's armor, floating in space... waiting for you. Before you can react, a noise draws your ire as your ship receives a direct message.</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Open the message.</text>

					<text>The message reads:
					
					ULTIMA_ARMOR:ONLINE
					SUBJECT_PRESENCE:NULL_REQUEST
					EXECUTING_COMMAND:SUBJECT_TERMINATION</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>This armor... can communicate?</text>
						<event>
							<text>As if to answer, the armor outside begins to glow with an ethereal light that pierces deeply into the clouds around you. The glow's intensity grows until a flash of light overtakes your vision, a sensation now familiar to you... by the time you can see again, the armor is gone, and in its place is a ship unlike any you've ever seen before.</text>

									<text>Lightning arcs from the ship and only barely misses yours as you realize this strange ship is made of pure electricity... or, at least, some sort of otherworldly energy. It approaches, and another bolt of lightning streaks past your ship. Get ready!</text>
