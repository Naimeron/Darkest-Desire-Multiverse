You yell to your crew to get their oxygen masks and, sure enough, the hole in the hull must've come from whatever was in the vent because all the oxygen in the ship is immediately vented out. The power swiftly returns in the nick of time and you're able to send some crew out to patch up the hole and restore the ship's oxygen, but that's not the end of it. Your crew claim that there's sector coordinates "written" on the hull, crudely cut into the ship.

Apparently, everyone had similar experiences; an overwhelming sense of dread followed by waiting in the darkness and refusing to speak to whatever was there. One particularly flustered crew member, however, reports that the being in the darkness actually spoke to them... nonstop, in fact. They claim it kept repeating a string of numbers, over, and over, and over, and over... until the power returned and nothing was there. Familiar with the patterning, you recognize the string of numbers as a set of sector coordinates.

					<text>You land, immersing yourself in the surrounding Deep One architecture; a sea of blues of and purples, complete with an excessive amount of blinding turquoise lights. The Deep Ones don't seem to mind your presence here, and eventually you home in on the source of the distress call. You're taken to a quiet corner of the settlement, one of the smaller houses at the end of the residential district. There still isn't anything that strikes you as an emergency as you stand at the door.</text>

Unless, I had just... misheard him." It thinks on this for a moment before continuing, "I'm so... terribly sorry for troubling you, officer.

The Deep One hands it to you, apologizes again, and you make your way back onto your ship and out of the settlement. This was a big waste of time, for the most part, but you do get to break down the beacon and get the barest amount of something out of it...</text>
