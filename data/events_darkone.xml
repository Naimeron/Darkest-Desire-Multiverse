																	<text>Mere inches away from you, Lilith stops. At lightning speed, a writhing tendril tears itself from her body and... grabs the photo. It seems to be capable of keeping her calm, slowly, and politely, you take the photo back, to which Lilith makes no move to stop you. As you leave the room and make for your ship, she follows, and you realize you've pacified an eldritch abomination... still, she's your friend, too. Once you're back on the ship, you take out the book, and Lilith reacts to its presence with a low growl.</text>

																			<text>Flipping through its pages, you realize you can't read any of it. It's written in a script that none of your translators or crew recognize... save for Lilith, who stares at the crimson text with intensity. With a mysterious ink expelled from her body, she writes out a cipher on the floor at your request... you wonder just how much of her is still in there, if she's capable of such a thing. Eventually, with the cipher finished, you're able to recognize that the text does indeed depict several rituals... most notably, a ritual that allows one to ascend and convene with the Dark One. You glance at Lilith.</text>

																					<text>She growls, and you gulp. Delving further into the book's pages, there's other colors of text, ones that Lilith's cipher doesn't cover. She must not be able to read all of them... maybe you can find someone who can. In the meantime, there appear to be a few rituals that increase the extent of one's power, given that they've already performed the ascension ritual. If you perform these rituals, you might be able to make Lilith stronger... who knows what price you might have to pay, though.</text>

You don't know what has become of her, and you sure as hell don't trust such a nightmare with your life. As you make for the ship, you hear Lilith... sob, behind you. It's a disturbing, twisted sobbing. You can't let it phase you, though... you still need to get out of this hellish realm.</text>
