	<text>Bits of Soulplague-infected matter go flying in random directions as the Husk ship breaks apart, but you're able to avoid their path and find what resources you can among the wreckage.</text>
	<text>Good riddance... one less batch of Husks left to plague the galaxy. Hopefully, the ship's previous owners can rest easy now that you've avenged them.</text>
	<text>That's the end of that. You shiver, considering the possibility that your ship and its crew could very well meet a similar fate at the mattervirus' hands, but there's little to worry about if you can keep these victories against its Husks consistent.</text>
	<text>Destroying ships overtaken by Husks is bittersweet, but reaping their rewards is evidently less so. Blasting zombies to hell, and collecting fat stacks of scrap and resources... you could get used to this, if this place didn't make you feel so uncomfortable.</text>
	<text>Soulplague-infected wrecks are only slightly safer to be around than when they're fully functional, but you're confident enough in your abilities to discern between authentic matter and... the more icky bits.</text>

He pauses as he gets a good look at you, and the relief on his face dissolves away into a grimace much more sour, "...that some hooligan would come across me first.

It doesn't matter whether you, an underling, or one of this horrid sector's abominable Husks found me; I am to be revived as soon I'm within an environment considered suitable for habitation. Thus is the Tempest's will."</text>

We don't exactly see eye to eye, but it ensures that my work may continue in exchange for these - these DAMN tasks! It HAD to be the Seraphim! This armor may render me nigh immortal, but it makes being immolated no more pleasant! The bastards got my ship, as well, by the look of things..."

											<text>There's a moment as he groans, and clenches his free hand, before he relents with a defeated tone, "I do suppose I'm stuck here for the time being. It would seem that this chance encounter is more fated that I'd presumed... I suspect that the Tempest wants me here, regardless of my own desires. Very well; I will answer your questions, belligerent one. Ask away..."</text>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>You mentioned that this Tempest is your patron. What does that entail, exactly? Who are they?</text>
												<event>
													<text>"It is less of a 'who' and more of a 'what'. The Tempest, as I've come to know it, is a construct most grand, located in a realm well beyond the seams that bind our reality. Something of a... pocket dimension. Many years ago, I'd sacrificed everything to reach this so-called promised land and have an audience with the thing... it was said to grant miracles. To fulfill one's grandest desires. Yet, I feel that it's done little but toy with me!" The man pauses for a moment, gesturing to his armor, "It took what felt like forever just to get it to acknowledge me, and when it finally did, it branded me in this DAMNABLE armor! It's been decades since I was forced to don it, and not once within that time have I been free from its confines."</text>
													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>What is it exactly?</text>
														<event>
															<text>He sighs, "Hell if I know. The Tempest uses it to control me, in its own way... sending me on these frivolous death sentences. That's not to say it's without its perks, though; the armor doesn't allow me to die, and among the Tempest's blessings are powers most useful. Immortality may be seen as a curse to some, but... I've a mission, here in life, that I simply cannot allow myself to fail. The armor ensures that, in its own way."</text>
															<choice hidden="true">
																<text>That's a lot to absorb... let's take a step back for a moment. The Shells we fought also mentioned these seams; what are they?</text>
																<event>
																	<text>You mention the strange Shells you encountered, and the man's grimace deepens, "The Seraphim... yes, they care to see to it that these seams are not breached, and that interdimensional travelers looking to enter their lane, so to speak, fail to do so." He looks you over, judgmentally, "I... don't suppose you're familiar with Universal Cluster Theory?"</text>
																	<choice hidden="true">
																		<text>I, uh, can't say I am.</text>
																		<event>
																			<text>"I can hardly blame you; merely suggesting that there may be some truth to it was almost enough to get me kicked from the force back in my time as an engineer for the Rebellion." He notices as you tense up at that, and rolls his eyes, "That was many years ago as well, Renegade. I've no love for them now. Not after..." The man drifts off for a moment, before shaking his head, "...anyways. Universal Cluster Theory is hardly scientific, to say the least, and its supporting evidence is shoddy at best, but it suggests that realities within our Multiverse are segmented via similar defining aspects; consider that nobody has ever seen a dimension composed entirely of chocolate pudding, for example. The theory suggests that this can be explained by the fact that no reality akin to ours could possibly ever be composed entirely of chocolate pudding, and that we may merely find realities more in-line with our own 'cluster'; say, one where Slugs love to eat chocolate pudding for no reason apparent to us."</text>
																			<choice hidden="true">
																				<text>Right... and where do the Seraphim come into this?</text>
																				<event>
																					<text>He scratches his chin, "If a dimension composed entirely of chocolate pudding sounds unfeasible, consider one composed ALMOST entirely of fire and brimstone. This is from where the Seraphim hail; a hell entirely alien to us, but the place they call home nonetheless. I've... been there, during a time where the Seraphim were less aggressive towards outsiders. Their reality remains the closest to the pocket dimension from which the Tempest sits, and so it acts as something of a direct gateway to it. The problem with this... are the Multiverse's seams. Regardless of whether or not one subscribes to Universal Cluster Theory, I have gathered enough evidence firsthand to prove that some realities are undoubtedly much more difficult to travel into than ones we'd consider familiar; crossing into the Seraphim's reality, for example, requires locating and precisely exploiting a gap in spacetime. The Seraphim called these gaps 'breaches in the seams', and I merely adopted the term after my brief incursion through their reality."</text>
																					<choice hidden="true">
																						<text>Fuck, alright... that's a lot to take in. You mentioned that the Seraphim used to be less aggressive. Did something happen?</text>
																						<event>
																							<text>"I'm not privy to the details myself. From what little interaction I've had with them since, it seems they've turned to hating the Tempest and any who would seek to interact with it. Perhaps the nature of its location, and the fact that people must travel through their reality to reach it? It's hard for me to say, but the fact of the matter is that they defend these breaches in the seams with their lives, as you've seen here today."</text>
																							<choice hidden="true">
																								<text>Speaking of... is that why you came out here, then? To breach the seams and enter the Seraphim's reality again?</text>
																								<event>
																									<text>He shakes his head at that, "Oh, by the Tempest, no. I've little interest in ever witnessing that hell again. The Tempest demanded it, and I do as the Tempest demands. It's as simple as that, and I can't question it, even if I wanted to. The most I can do is theorize that it wants this breach left open for someone, or something, and has used me to ensure that that's the case."</text>
																									<choice hidden="true">
																										<text>If the breach is open, then... could we enter it?</text>
																										<event>
																											<text>The old man laughs, "Not unless you've a death wish! Even if you did have one, though, the breach has only merely been binded. It still requires precise exploitation to reach the exact dimension you want; lest you mistakenly drown in chocolate pudding." You give him a certain look, and his face darkens, "No, I am not performing any such 'precise exploitation' for the sake of your curiosity. You may find someone else knowledgable on the matter if you wish to die, but I'd struggle to believe anybody else in-the-know would be suicidal enough to agree to it. I only did it, so long ago, because I felt I had no other choice..."</text>
																											<choice hidden="true">
																												<text>Right... you keep alluding to that. What drove you to travel through hell and seek the Tempest's audience, then?</text>
																												<event>
																													<text>"I'd... briefly mentioned my involvement with the Rebellion earlier. To elaborate, I worked amongst Vance's team of Head Engineers; I was tasked with perfecting the Multiverse Drive and securing an advantage over the competition. We were to breach realities others couldn't dream of finding, and guarantee a Rebel victory the easy way. It was during my research on this project that I stumbled upon Universal Cluster Theory, as well as... darker findings."</text>
																													<choice hidden="true">
																														<text>Darker findings? Such as?</text>
																														<event>
																															<text>He shivers, "Evidence of dimensions much more frightening than our own; evidence suggesting that we were making a terrible mistake in trying to escape the familiarity of dimensions akin to Universe 0. Even at the time, I was disturbed, but cancelling the project wasn't my call to make... to this day, I still don't know where exactly the orders came from. Some simpleton higher up, too high on the promise of glory to consider the consequences. The consequences that I would be the one to pay! The consequences that... my daughter would pay."</text>

																																<text>Your daughter...</text>

																																	<text>"Yes, my darling Evelyn..." For a moment, he sounds close to tears, but you get the feeling, as he stares off into space, that he's lamented over the matter for so long that he struggles to bring himself to shed anymore tears for her. After a moment, he continues, "It was an ordinary day at the lab; we were testing one of the prototype Multiverse Drives. She'd insisted that she come along and watch, and I... was a terrible father. I couldn't bring myself to tell her no, and it..." There's another pause, as he looks to the floor, "...something went wrong with the experiment, and the Drive begun to tear the place apart. The last I saw of Evelyn before it pulled her through an interdimensional vortex was the smile she gave me, like nothing could harm her as long as I was around..." His stature sinks, even deeper, before he continues again, "...I was devastated. We managed to shut the Drive off before much more was lost, but it was already too late at that point. I'd felt like I'd lost everything."</text>
																																	<choice hidden="true">
																																		<text>I see. I'm sorry...</text>
																																		<event>
																																			<text>The old man looks up at you, "Don't be. I only have myself to blame... and blame myself I did. Though I would continue working for the Rebellion for some time, it was mostly a front to further my own goals at that point. My goal of finding her... of bringing Evelyn back..." He begins to stare off at nothing again, "...I'd come to meet a man. One robed in golden silks finer than any I'd ever dreamed of seeing. I shared with him my plight; I couldn't even say why, really, but I felt that I could trust him. He would nod, and listen along as I lamented. Eventually, this would become a habit, and we'd meet up for this pseudo-therapy more often... until, one day, he offered me a solution. He told me of the Tempest; of how it granted wishes. Of the seams between reality, and how to reach it from them. It all sounded so insane, but I was so... desperate. I stole away with one of the Multiverse Drives, and did as the man had instructed. That's the last I ever saw of him, or the Rebellion... I've been the Tempest's Hand ever since that journey concluded."</text>
																																			<choice hidden="true">
																																				<text>So, you work for the Tempest, but... what of your wish?</text>
																																				<event>
																																					<text>"I'm not sure. So much time has passed, and never once has the Tempest spoken a word to me. The only choice I'm left with is to do as it wills me, through this armor... to run its Cult, perform its rituals and spread its blessings. I've no clue to what end." He looks at you, a sadness in his eyes, "I can only pray that at the end of this journey, the Tempest grants my wish, and I can see her again."</text>

			<text>As if to prove your proclamation right, you receive a hail from an unknown location as you throw your tantrum. Eager to get the loot you've earned, you accept it, and are met with the backside of an elderly man clad in black armor as he tinkers with something out of view, "Vydoorin, you're late; again! Were you expecting me to deal with this matter myself? The hour is nearly upon us, and we're left with little time to prepare the rites thanks to you and your sect's tardiness. Tell me, have you at least brought the binding regent?" You're unsure of how to respond, and the man repeats himself after a moment, "Well? You have, haven't you?"</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>I, uh...</text>
				<event>
					<text>You stammer over your words, and the man turns around, "Are you TRYING to-" He pauses mid-sentence as he sees you, blinks a few times, and then puts a finger to his temple as a look of annoyance washes over his face, "You are not Vydoorin. Tell me; how did you find me here, in the middle of nowhere?"</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Well, I...</text>
						<event>
							<text>He cuts you off, as you stumble over your words, "Oh, it hardly matters. We're almost out of time... looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way." The man moves his head to the side a little, as if it would help him see over your shoulder, before shaking his head and sighing, "Your vessel will have to do. It seems capable enough, if little else."</text>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>What? What are you talking about?</text>
								<event>
									<text>"So you CAN speak! Enlightening. Listen here, intruder, and listen well. I can only imagine what you've done to Vydoorin's sect to find your way here, but I am left with little option but to put that aside for the sake of what's to come." He motions towards a window with his spare hand, the other still to his temple, "There is only one way we may both survive this- well, there is only one way YOU may survive this. My survival is all but guaranteed, but that's beside the point. You must handle the brunt of their force while I perform the binding... regentless, thanks to your meddling, but it should remain feasible as long as you simply DON'T die. Can you manage that?"</text>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>Hold on. THEIR force? You're still speaking vaguely...</text>
										<event>
											<text>The man slams his armored fist against the console, "The Seraphim, dammit! They're almost-" He's interrupted as a flash of light from outside overtakes the both of you, its sheer brilliance piercing even the nebula around you, and you're left dazed...</text>

													<text>As you come to, and the blinding light fades, you realize in its place sits a Shell ship wreathed in truly radiant flames. The man's annoyed demeanor drops as he sees this ship himself, and continues speaking, in a low whisper, "They're here. Remember: do NOT die. I will send what little assistance I can afford to spare when a fight inevitably breaks out. And don't even try to think about running; I've ensured you can't. Consider it Vydoorin's final regards." Indeed, you check, and it looks like your FTL drive has been overloaded with energy somehow, crippling it for the time being... it seems you'll have to do as the old man asks.</text>

One of them speaks as you're lost in their collective magnificence, "So it is a Renegade, of thhhe Federation, thhhhat would seek to exploit thhhis fault in thhhhe seams... thhhhus is it our duty to punish thhhis insolence, and ensure thhhhat thhhis fault is closed. Burn before thhhhe light, and repent; so thhhhat thhhe taint withhhin you may be purged, and we may know peace once more!"

					<text>An explosion from behind you sends you flying into the ship's console, and you turn around to see... someone armored head-to-toe, stepping out of some kind of portal. No, not so much stepping out as much as they're fighting their way out - the spear in their hands tearing away at the goopy, oily tentacles that threaten to pull them in. You realize that you recognize these tentacles... this is Soulplague-infected matter! You watch, in awe, as the figure finishes cutting away at the tentacles, and the portal shuts closed behind them. They take a moment to wipe themself off, deactivated Soulplague matter splattering against the floor as they do so, before turning to you, pointing at themself, and finally speaking:
					
					"It means... you're gonna need a little help!"
					
					You figure that sounded cooler in their head, and you're still not really sure what that means, but at the very least you're able to remark on their voice. Though they're muffled behind their helmet, you feel that they sound feminine, theatrical and exhausted. Especially exhausted.</text>

								<text>Do you mean that weird series of rhymes?</text>
								<event>
									<text>She puts her gauntlets together, spear still in hand, awkwardly, "YES! You've answered the hero's call! Good, because there's not a lot of time to waste; the Children... or, uh, maybe the Weavers now that I think about it... not important! Point being, they're going to come and drag me back any minute now. You, uh..." She pauses as she gets a good look at you, and her energy tones down a bit, "...you're not one of us. It's no wonder you can't see it. That's okay, though; you've still answered the call! You've got a hero's heart, and that's all that matters! Though, it does make this rather awkward... do you have any idea what's happening?"</text>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>Not a clue.</text>
										<event>
											<text>"I see... well, you're my only chance now, lest I wait another lifetime! I'll have to make this as quick as I can." She gathers her thoughts for a moment, and then puts an armored hand to her heart, "Long ago... no, that's stupid. Listen. Something's out to keep me trapped; something ancient, malevolent and calculating. It would trick a collective of Shells to do so, and damn the entire Multiverse while it's at it; you have to have seen the echoes of its work if you've come this close to their center, right?" She gestures outside, and stares inquisitively.</text>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>Do you mean the Soulplague mattervirus?</text>
												<event>
													<text>The armored woman nods, "It doesn't matter what you want to call it; what it is, is entropy incarnate. It's less of a 'matter' virus, though that name's still apt, and more of a 'spacetime' virus - as far as I can tell, it's been bastardized for the sole purpose of my eternal torment. The Shells who unknowingly created it were wanting the perfect mimic; something that could mirror the characteristics of anything, or anyone, for the purpose of labor. They would come close to achieving this, but ultimately fall short at the finish line... it would be the resulting desperation that compelled them to make a deal they couldn't possibly comprehend the consequences of. This mimic of theirs would be twisted, by dark forces, into what you now call the Soulplague mattervirus: an engine with which to corrupt matter, and use it to create an extradimensional prison. One that bends the laws of space, and time, in order to accomplish one goal: keeping ME trapped forever."</text>
													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>Well... you don't look particularly trapped. Or extradimensional, for that matter.</text>
														<event>
															<text>She throws her hands in the air, "HEY! Don't you be getting sarcastic with ME! It's not easy fending off endless waves of mindless, tentacled freaks for... one, two... four... ugh, I don't know, centuries? Wow, yeah... you're really the first person I've talked to since this whole thing's started."</text>
															<choice hidden="true">
																<text>Wait, centuries?! Like, literally?</text>
																<event>
																	<text>"YES, literally! Well... also no, not literally. Like I said, this extradimensional prison doesn't function by the same rules as the rest of the Multiverse - it's quite genuinely an extra dimension. It's layered on top of everything, such as time, and space, but also ignorant of it all... for the most part. It's not perfect; part of it still bleeds back through, and that's how you get the supposed results of this 'mattervirus'. This bleeding is misleading, though; the majority of the junk it eats is sent back my way... you'd be seeing waves, in comparison to the oceans I'm forced to drown in." She holds one hand at her waist, and the other way up high, as if that's necessary to illustrate her point.</text>
																	<choice hidden="true">
																		<text>Alright, and you... what? Broke out of these oceans?</text>
																		<event>
																			<text>She resets her hands, and shakes her head, "Oh, how I wish I could. I'm only here on borrowed time... time I've slowly accrued over the course of these infinite, ceaseless battles. TIME, WITH WHICH I AM TO END THIS NIGHTMARE ONCE AND FOR ALL!" She gets loud, out of nowhere, but calms back down when she notices that she's startled you, "Well, yes, my tormentors should return any second now. That's where you come in - when they take me back, I would ask that you follow suit. Normally, I wouldn't dream of involving anyone else in this, but I fear there's no other way to end this madness; TRUST ME, I've tried, but the longer I wait... the more time its 'bleeding' is given to devour the realities underneath it." Indeed, you've seen the state this sector's in... if you don't act, would the mattervirus one day come to overtake other sectors, too? Would its expansion ever end?</text>
																			<choice hidden="true">
																				<text>Well, what am I supposed to do? You sound, uh... pretty capable.</text>
																				<event>
																					<text>Your comment seems to have stroked her ego slightly, "Well, as capable as I am, there's still only so many of me. The rate at which the metaphorical ocean grows far outpaces the rate at which I can quell it, and it's proven efficient at preventing my approach of its heart. If you could reach it yourself, though, and buy me enough time to break through... I could pierce it, with ONE MIGHTY BLOW, and put an end to its corruption for good!" The armored woman poses, triumphantly, and you can't help but feel a little embarrassed.</text>
																					<choice hidden="true">
																						<text>You're certain that this heart exists? And that it's the only thing keeping the mattervirus going?</text>
																						<event>
																							<text>She nods, "You'll see what I mean soon enough, if you haven't already, but it has a way of worming its way into your mind. For better, or for worse, I don't think there's anything its collective hive mind knows that I don't at this point." You squint a little at how insane that sounds, but she doesn't seem to notice as she points her spear in the air, "Now, tell me - are you to be the fellow hero I seek? There is little shame in walking away; as troublesome as it'll be to get another opportunity like this, I loathe asking such a harrowing task of anyone, and I cannot guarantee that you and your comrades here will make it out with their lives."</text>

																								<text>This sounds absurd, but... screw it, I'm in.</text>
																								<event>
																									<text>There's a loud, clanging noise as she slams the butt of her spear against the floor, and puts her hand to her chest once more, "THAT'S THE HEROIC SPIRIT! To fight for no reason, other than because it is what's right... THIS is how heroes are born. If you are to venture with me into the belly of the beast, then you will be needing this!" She holds her hand out, palm up, and tenses it... for a moment, you're left wondering what's supposed to happen, but then a resplendent, roaring flame bursts out from the very air between her fingertips! She pulls her hand back, and the golden fire stays hovering in the air where she left it, "This... is 'hope'. The prison's Children, or, heavens forbid, its Weavers, will undoubtedly try to bargain with you once you're within their realm. They may promise power, freedom, peace, WHATEVER; all of it will be lies for the sole purpose of luring you to your death. THAT, is where 'hope' comes in. It is a fraction of my power, and what's caused my imprisonment in the first place... it is to act as your torch in the upcoming darkness. Invoke it, and you may burn away the shadows of doubt, revealing truth... what that truth entails, exactly, is up to you. I only ask that you use it wisely, for its power is finite." She gestures for you to take the flame, and you hestitantly cup it in your hands... but it doesn't burn you. Rather, you feel that you find it soothing.</text>
