					<text>Bringing them aboard through the airlock, you find that is indeed a Disparity Elite, but, despite floating in space for what you can only assume must have at least been days, they're in strangely good condition. Weirder yet, they're clutching onto a leather-bound book... and, before even taking a moment to relax, they speak, "[Brother.] You're: here, just as -he- said." Vaguely ominous...</text>

He: wanted you: to have [this.]" They raise the book, and you get a closer look at it... unfortunately, there's very little to make note of. The book is untitled, simply leather-bound, brown, with a single latch that keeps it closed. The Engi continues, "He: [bid] that I: -deliver- it."</text>

This, he: made [very] clear." They gesture for you to take it, and, with the book in your hands, you realize how strangely... warm it is, despite having been in the vacuum of space for so long. "I: am to -return- now. Farewell, [brother.]" They move to make for the inner airlock, and you glance at the book.</text>

Shadows gone!" They gesture to open the door, and, trusting your newfound friend, you open it... indeed, the stars have returned. You breathe a sigh of relief as you return to the ship with the Free Mantis in tow. Seems they intend to join you, and you're more than ready to get the hell out of here.</text>

	<text>The Disparity appears to have control over this beacon... untrusting, the guard assigned to its protection prepares for an assault!</text>

	<text>Or, so you thought. As the Seraphim die, they send out one final trump card: a brilliant beam of light that pierces the Disparity Behemoth's hull. As it cracks, and shatters, a sea of darkness springs forth from its encasement... it surrounds you, the Disparity, the Link, everything. You watch as some of it coalesces into a sphere, next to the Link... and then, as the sphere reverberates and writhes, you feel as your ship begins to be pulled in... it's having some kind of gravitational effect on the entire area!</text>

They begin sliding away, and you can't help but notice that despite the loss of their flagship, their kin, and the Link... they seem somewhat jovial. I suppose you have accomplished a great victory here, defeating the Seraphim and destroying the Harmony Link. Although, you have to wonder... was it really destroyed? Hey, wait!
