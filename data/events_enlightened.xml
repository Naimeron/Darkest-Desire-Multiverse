My beloved, too, has heard tell of it." He gestures to Lilith again, who raises her head to speak, "I've... overheard the Elders speaking of it.

If you ever intend to search for us..." he pauses, typing something, and you hear a small beep as your ship receives a detailed FTL signature, "...you'll know how to find us, if we're still alive." Kyr sits up, his face lightening once more, "Not that I can seriously suggest following us to such a hellish place! Just, if you DO happen to follow the call of the true explorer and find yourself in the Dark God's neighborhood. Besides, we're not even entirely certain it actually exists!" Kyr laughs once more, but Lilith seems slightly disturbed.</text>

One of the few noble factions left in the entire Multiverse. There's nobody greater to trust with our location, my love." This appears to comfort Lilith somewhat. The two bid you farewell, and you're left alone with the darkness as they jump out of the beacon. That is, you're left with not only the darkness, but also the voice, who speaks, "How... charming.

	<text>While cleaning out the ship you come across a dying Enlightened who meets your gaze and mutters a prayer to the Dark God before collapsing and dying. Great, now you've been cursed...</text>
	<text>During the scrapping operation, your crew comments that the lights adorning the Enlightened's hull appear to never die. You find that quite ironic.</text>
	<text>You pull up a database on Old Earth marine life as your crew explores the now-empty ship. The Enlightened have fine taste in ship architecture, yet they have finer scrap.</text>
	<text>Though you barely understand the creatures you've just slaughtered, you can't help but feel like it didn't have to end this way.</text>
	<text>You breathe a sigh of relief once it's been confirmed that the crew's been eliminated. Every second spent in this void is another you'd much rather be spending just about anywhere else.</text>
	<text>Amidst scrapping, your crew begins to argue about what color the lights the Enlightened use are. Obviously they're yellow, but you don't want to ruin their fun... not that it really matters amidst all this darkness, does it?</text>
