Patch after Multiverse (5.5), and make sure your Hyperspace is updated! You need to patch this after other addons and use the FTLman mod manager in order to get the Corruptor system on said addons' ships.

Darkest Desire is a general content mod focused on new, dark and lore-heavy sectors, as well as everything else! Including: many new sectors (some secret, some otherwise!), a new system (the Corruptor), new races, such as the Deep Ones or the Soulplague Husks, Elite and Super Elite variants for existing races (namely both Shells and Engi right now), terrifying new Horror crew, new Uniques, new ships, new augments, mechanics, hazards, weapons, drones, etcetera! To get started, look for non-unique neutral and unique hostile/hazard sectors.

A big thank you to Lizzard for creating all of Darkest Desire's music, another big thank you to Arc for the creation of most of the Corruptor system's Lua, yet another thank you to Silly and Chrono for further Lua help, a big thank you to my boyfriend for being lovely and also helping me with a few sprites, and one final big thank you to everyone in the Multiverse Discord server who helps me with any questions I have! As well, I'd like to thank the Eldritch Horrors team for inspiring me to make this addon. My original goal was to revive EH itself, but as the team dissolved I set out to make something new. There's a long road ahead, but I'm looking forward to it!
