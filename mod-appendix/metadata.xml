Patch after Multiverse (5.4.6), and make sure your Hyperspace is updated!

Darkest Desire is a general content mod focused on new, lore-heavy sectors, as well as everything else! Including: a new race, the Deep Ones, Elites and Super Elites for existing races (namely the Engi right now), new Uniques, new ships, new augments, mechanics, weapons, drones, etcetera! To get started, look for non-unique neutral and unique hostile sectors.

A big thank you to Lizzard for creating the track "Light's Lament", as well as to everyone in the Multiverse Discord server who would help me with any questions I had! As well, I'd like to thank the Eldritch Horrors team for inspiring me to make this addon. My original goal was to revive EH itself, but as the team dissolved I set out to make something new. There's a long road ahead, but I'm looking forward to it! Lastly, I'd like to thank my boyfriend for being lovely and creating the Divine Duality sprite for me (I was really struggling with it lol)!
