Patch after Multiverse (5.3+), and make sure your Hyperspace is updated to 1.8.0!

Darkest Desire adds a new race, the Deep Ones, and their corresponding sectors, ships, weapons, events, augments, bosses, etc. I'd prefer to keep the description brief, as I believe it's best played blind, but there will be more information in the forum post should you desire it. In the meantime, to get started, search for friendly non-unique sectors for the Deep One sector and see if you can't uncover anything... lest something uncover you first.

A big thank you to everyone in the Multiverse Discord server who would help me with any questions I had! As well, I'd like to thank the Eldritch Horrors team for inspiring me to make this addon. My original goal was to revive EH itself, but as the team dissolved I set out to make something new. There's a long road ahead, but I'm looking forward to it!
